# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier with neural network model to predict if applicants will be successful by Alphabet Soup funding them.
## Results
### Data Preprocessing
* The target variable is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column in the dataframe called application_df.
* All the other columns are the target variables in application_df.
*
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

## Summary
### Recommendation
The Random Forest model could solve this classification problem as well. A benefit of Random Forest is how it is robust to outliers. This model can rank the importance of input variables in a natural way and runs efficiently on large datasets.
